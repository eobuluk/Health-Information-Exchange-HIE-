# Facility Readiness Assessment to Transition to Health Information Exchange (HIE) and Paperless Viral Load Requests
## Objective
This project aimed to evaluate the readiness of healthcare facilities to transition to a Health Information Exchange (HIE) system, enabling paperless viral load requests. The objective was to improve data flow and management by integrating viral load test requests and results into Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).
## Key Activities: 
### Planning and Stakeholder Engagement
- Conducted entry meetings with district and city health officers, implementing partners, hospital administrators, ART clinic in-charges, and data teams.
- Outlined objectives and methodologies to stakeholders, fostering alignment on the project’s goals.
### Facility Visits
- Assessed 20 health facilities across eight districts for readiness indicators, such as infrastructure, internet availability, data security, and EMR usage.
- Used structured tools and patient-chart reviews to verify data quality and synchronization.
## Data Analysis and Visualization
- Analyzed collected data in Excel, generating visualizations such as:
- Trends in internet and power availability.
- Data synchronization discrepancies between EMRs and HMIS tools.
## Presentation of findings
- Compiled findings into a PowerPoint report, using charts and graphs to present results clearly and effectively.
- Delivered a visualized analysis report in PowerPoint format during debriefing sessions with health teams, implementing partners, and district leadership.
- Highlighted gaps, strengths, and actionable recommendations to enhance readiness for HIE adoption.
## Outcome:
The project effectively communicated readiness challenges and facilitated collaborative decision-making. This enabled stakeholders to prioritize interventions for transitioning to paperless viral load requests and strengthening Uganda’s digital health systems.
## Tools and technologies used: 
- Analysis: Data cleaning and visualization in Excel.
- Presentation: Visualized insights using PowerPoint to deliver an accessible and engaging summary of findings.
